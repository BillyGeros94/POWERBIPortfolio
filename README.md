# Power BI Portfolio

This repository showcases a collection of Power BI projects that highlight my skills and experience in data analysis, visualization, and reporting. Each project demonstrates how I leveraged Power BI's capabilities to extract insights from data and present them in an interactive and user-friendly way.

Contents

- **Project 1: Book Sales**

    An interactive Book Sales Dashboard designed to provide an in-depth analysis of book sales performance. The dashboard begins with an overview, highlighting key metrics such as the total number of authors, genres, and overall book sales.

    This is followed by a detailed breakdown, featuring visually engaging charts that offer deeper insights. A horizontal bar chart showcases the top 5 selling genres, while a vertical bar chart displays the top 5 publishers. Additionally, bar charts provide a clear view of the best-selling authors and books, complete with well-structured legends for easy interpretation.

    Through intuitive visualizations and interactive elements, the dashboard enables users to explore and analyze book sales data effectively.

- **Project 2: Chelsea PL Data**

    This report focuses on Chelsea F.C.'s historical Premier League performance, providing a comprehensive analysis through engaging visualizations.

    The report features vertical bar charts that display key metrics such as the club's wins, total points, and goal difference per season, offering a clear, season-by-season breakdown of performance. Additionally, line charts are used to illustrate Chelsea's league position and goals scored each season, providing a dynamic view of trends and progression over time.

    By combining these visualizations, the report offers valuable insights into Chelsea's consistency, scoring prowess, and league standing throughout their Premier League history.
  
- **Project 3: Coffee Consumption Dataset**
  
    This interactive report offers an in-depth analysis of coffee consumption patterns through a variety of engaging visualizations.

    The report features horizontal bar charts that display coffee consumption by type, providing a clear comparison across different coffee varieties. Vertical bar charts highlight the amount of money spent per coffee type, along with insights into the top card payers. To illustrate trends over time, line graphs are used to track monthly coffee consumption and spending.

    Additionally, a donut chart showcases the distribution of money spent by payment method, offering a visually appealing breakdown of customer payment preferences. Together, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of coffee consumption habits and spending patterns, empowering users to explore the data in an interactive and intuitive way.

- **Project 4: Store Sales Data**

    This report provides a comprehensive analysis of key metrics from a store sales dataset through a variety of detailed visualizations.

    Vertical bar charts are utilized to display the store's best-selling products, total shipping costs by shipping method, and the most profitable regions, offering clear insights into these crucial aspects. A horizontal bar chart highlights the best-selling subcategories, while an interactive map visually represents the five most profitable countries by profit.

    Additionally, a donut chart showcases profitability across different years, and a treemap chart breaks down profitability by category for a more granular view. A funnel chart is also included to visualize the store's top clients by profit, allowing for an easy comparison of customer contributions to profitability. Together, these visualizations provide a holistic view of sales performance and profitability across various dimensions.

- **Project 5: Student Mobile Health Effects**
  
   This interactive dashboard presents the results of a survey on students' perceptions of mobile health effects, offering a comprehensive view through various visualizations.

   A donut chart is used to display the gender distribution of the participants, while a stacked vertical bar chart visualizes the mobile operating systems (OS) used by students, broken down by gender. Vertical bar charts are employed to illustrate students' responses to key questions, such as daily mobile usage, beneficial subjects of mobile use, the frequency of health symptoms, and precautions taken for mobile usage.

   Horizontal bar charts are used to present the percentages of students who reported the impact of mobile phones on their academic performance and the appearance of specific health symptoms related to mobile phone use. Each visualization is expressed as a percentage, providing clear insights into the students' collective responses. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore the effects of mobile phone usage on health and performance in an intuitive manner.
