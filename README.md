- **Project 1: Premier League 23-24**

   This project explores various metrics and performance indicators from the 2023/2024 Premier League season, based on data sourced from FBREF. By analyzing possession against 
   performance, there's a clear relationship between how much teams control the ball and their overall effectiveness. The chart highlights certain outliers, where teams like Manchester 
   City and Arsenal dominate possession, whereas others like Luton Town perform poorly despite similar possession metrics. Another analysis contrasts expected contributions (xG and 
   xAG) against actual contributions (goals and assists), showing which teams are overperforming or underperforming relative to their expected metrics. Notably, Liverpool, Manchester 
   City, and Arsenal stand out for outperforming their expected metrics, while teams like Sheffield United and Everton underperform significantly, as evidenced by the -14 contribution 
   for Everton.

   The goals breakdown offers insights into how teams score—whether through non-penalty goals (npG) or penalties (PK). Manchester City and Arsenal lead the table in overall goals, 
   showcasing their high offensive output. At the same time, teams like Sheffield United and Everton have significantly fewer goals, indicating clear issues in their attacking 
   performance. The relationship between squad age and performance is also explored, suggesting that teams with younger squads (around 25-26 years old) tend to perform better on non- 
   penalty expected goals (npxG), though there's a drop-off for both older and younger squads.

   The comparison between expected goals and actual performance further reinforces these findings, where top-performing teams like Manchester City and Arsenal consistently outperform 
   their xG. Meanwhile, teams such as Luton Town struggle to match their expected goals, highlighting inefficiency in converting chances. Another key aspect is progressive actions, 
   where progressive passes and carries (PrgA) are compared with goals and assists (G+A). Teams like Liverpool and Manchester City excel at turning progressive actions into tangible 
   outcomes, while lower-performing teams struggle to do so.

   Finally, the team efficiency chart captures the balance between assists (A) and goals (G). Teams like Manchester City, Arsenal, and Brighton demonstrate high efficiency, excelling 
   both in creating and finishing chances. On the other hand, teams such as Everton and Luton Town show inefficiency, with fewer assists and goals relative to other teams. These 
   findings suggest a significant divide in the league between high-performing, efficient teams and those that lag both in creating and converting opportunities.

- **Project 2: Chelsea PL Data**

   This Power BI project visualizes Chelsea Football Club's performance in the Premier League from 1990 to 2025, focusing on key metrics such as matches won, points, goals scored, goal 
   difference, and league position. The dashboard provides a historical view of Chelsea's progress and fluctuations over the years.

   The League Matches Won Per Season chart shows the number of matches Chelsea has won each season. Chelsea’s performance peaks in the mid-2000s, with notable highs such as 29 and 30 
   wins around 2005 and 2015, reflecting their dominance during these periods. However, the club's performance fluctuates in recent years, with a noticeable drop in wins after 2020.

   The Goal Difference Per Season graph further highlights Chelsea's varying fortunes. The goal difference climbs steadily from the 1990s, peaking at +71 in the early 2010s. This 
   period 
   marks Chelsea’s offensive and defensive prowess, especially under successful managers. However, more recent seasons show a marked decline in goal difference, even reaching negative 
   figures, which indicates struggles in both scoring and defense.

   The League Position Per Season line chart traces Chelsea’s standings in the Premier League. After consistently being mid-table in the early 1990s, the club experiences a sharp rise 
   in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, regularly finishing in the top six. Between 2010 and 2020, Chelsea is a frequent top-four finisher, but a slight dip in performance can be seen 
   post- 
   2020, with the club dropping to 12th place in 2023.

   The Points Per Season bar chart reflects similar trends. Points accumulate steadily from the early 1990s, peaking in the mid-2000s with 95 points in 2005, coinciding with Chelsea's 
   title-winning seasons. The points per season remain competitive until recent years, where a drop to 63 points in 2023 suggests Chelsea is facing more challenges.

   Lastly, the Goals Scored Per Season line chart reveals Chelsea's attacking output. While the club consistently scores between 50 to 70 goals for much of its Premier League history, 
   significant spikes—such as 103 goals in 2010—show exceptional attacking seasons. Recently, Chelsea's goal-scoring has been more moderate, reflecting both tactical shifts and 
   possible 
   attacking inefficiencies.

   In conclusion, this dashboard offers a detailed look at Chelsea's Premier League history. It highlights the club's peak dominance during the 2000s and early 2010s, followed by more 
   recent struggles in terms of wins, points, and league position. The visualizations provide a clear overview of Chelsea's performance trends over time, capturing key periods of 
   success and recent challenges.
  
- **Project 3: Coffee Consumption Dataset**
  
    I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze coffee consumption patterns, focusing on the types of coffee purchased, monthly spending trends, payment methods, and top card spenders. 
    This visualization aims to give a comprehensive look at how customers interact with different coffee types, their spending habits, and payment preferences over time.

    The "Money Spent Per Coffee Type" visualization reveals that lattes and Americanos with milk are the most popular, each accounting for over 10K in spending. Cappuccinos follow 
    closely with 8.2K, while Americanos and Cortados see less expenditure at 5K and 3.3K, respectively. Espresso and Cocoa have the least spending, with only 1.3K and 1.6K. This 
    pattern reflects a strong preference for milk-based coffee drinks among customers.

    In terms of consumption, Americanos with milk are consumed the most, with 319 orders, followed by lattes at 282, and cappuccinos at 222. This shows that despite the high 
    consumption numbers for Americanos with milk, customers are willing to spend more on lattes and cappuccinos. Cortados and hot chocolate also have significant consumption, but 
    espressos and cocoa remain the least consumed.

    Looking at the "Money Spent Per Month" analysis, there’s a clear peak in April, where spending hits 9.1K, followed by a gradual decrease through to August. March saw relatively 
    lower spending at 7.1K, and August hit the lowest point at 5.1K. This drop in spending might reflect a seasonal pattern or changing customer preferences. Similarly, the "Coffee 
    Consumption Per Month" graph follows a similar trend, peaking in May with 267 orders and seeing a decline to 180 orders in August.

    I also examined payment preferences, where card payments dominate, accounting for 92.53% of total transactions, while cash makes up only 7.47%. This indicates that most customers 
    prefer using cards for their coffee purchases, which could be tied to convenience or store incentives.

    The dashboard also highlights the top five card spenders, with the highest spender (AN00-0000-0000-0) reaching 2.8K. The other top spenders follow closely, but all are under 2.5K. 
    This section of the dashboard helps identify the most loyal and high-value customers.

    Overall, the dashboard provides valuable insights into customer preferences, monthly trends, and top spenders, allowing for better decision-making when it comes to marketing, 
    inventory, and customer service strategies.

- **Project 4: Store Sales Data**

    I worked on a comprehensive sales data analysis project using Power BI, focusing on different aspects of performance across products, regions, and customer behavior. The dashboard 
    provides a holistic view of the business operations, highlighting key areas such as top-selling products, profit distribution, and geographical performance.

    One of the most insightful visualizations is the breakdown of best-selling products, where staples have emerged as the highest-selling product by a significant margin. Other 
    products like Cardinal Index Tabs and Eldon File Carts follow, but with a much lower sales volume. I also looked into best-selling subcategories, where Binders lead the way, 
    followed by Storage and Art supplies, reflecting the popularity of office essentials.

    In terms of yearly sales, there's a clear upward trajectory, with sales growing steadily from 2011 to 2014. By 2014, sales reached over 60K, indicating consistent growth over the 
    four years. Profitability is analyzed by year, with 2014 being the most profitable year, contributing 34.36% of total profits. The profit split also shows that 2011 contributed the 
    least (16.98%), but still holds significance.

    I also analyzed customer data to understand the top customers. Tamara Chand stands out as the top customer, followed by Raymond Buch and Sanjit Chand, showing high levels of 
    engagement. These top customers have been crucial to maintaining the revenue base.

    From a geographical perspective, the most profitable regions were analyzed, and Central came out as the top performer with profits of 0.31M. Other regions such as North Asia and 
    North America also contributed significantly, but the Central region was the standout. The shipping costs analysis shows that standard class shipping was the most used option, 
    reflecting its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, compared to other modes like same-day delivery, which incurred higher costs.

    Lastly, I focused on profit across different categories, where Technology products generated the most profit at 663.7K, followed by Office Supplies at 518.47K. Furniture, although 
    a key product, generated less profit comparatively. The entire dashboard delivers an in-depth understanding of how different aspects of the business contribute to the overall 
    growth and profitability, helping to pinpoint key drivers and areas for improvement.

- **Project 5: Student Mobile Health Effects**
  
   In this Power BI dashboard, I focused on analyzing the effects of mobile phone usage on students, looking into aspects such as gender distribution, mobile operating systems, daily 
   usage patterns, health symptoms, and the perceived impact on academic performance. The analysis aims to understand how students interact with their mobile phones, whether it aids in 
   studying, and the potential health consequences of prolonged usage.

   The student gender breakdown is heavily skewed towards females, who make up 81% of the sample, with males comprising only 19%. Regarding mobile operating systems, the majority of 
   students use iOS (79.1%), while 20.9% use Android. This highlights a strong preference for Apple products among the student population. When asked whether their mobile phones are 
   helpful for studying, an overwhelming 95.92% responded positively, showcasing the importance of mobile devices as study tools.

   The analysis of daily mobile phone usage reveals that 40% of students spend 4-6 hours on their phones daily, while 27.2% use them for 2-4 hours. Only 7.07% reported using their 
   phones for less than 2 hours a day, indicating significant screen time for most students. Interestingly, when asked if mobile phones affect their performance, 40.82% of students 
   agreed that they do, with another 29.95% remaining neutral. Only a small percentage (12.24%) strongly disagreed, indicating that the majority feel some impact, whether positive or 
   negative.

   Health-related symptoms caused by mobile usage were a major focus. The most common issue is the occurrence of all listed symptoms, which include sleep disturbances, headaches, and 
   anxiety, affecting 34.41% of respondents. Sleep disruption alone accounts for 27.86%, followed by headaches at 24.73%. A smaller portion, 12.9%, reported anxiety or stress. These 
   findings indicate that mobile usage can have noticeable effects on students' health, especially concerning sleep quality.

   Mobile usage also seems beneficial in academic contexts, with 48.64% of students primarily using their phones for research. Another 33.33% use their phones for browsing study 
   material, and a smaller group (18.18%) focuses on accounting tasks. However, the frequent appearance of symptoms such as sleep disruption could potentially undermine these benefits 
   over time.

   The dashboard also delves into symptom frequency, with 52.53% of students reporting that these symptoms occur "sometimes." Only 9.09% experience them frequently, while 21.21% and 
   17.17% experience symptoms either rarely or never. Students are taking some precautions to manage their mobile usage, with 35.35% limiting screen time. Others are using techniques 
   like taking breaks (21.21%) or using blue light filters (21.21%) to mitigate the negative effects.

   Overall, this dashboard offers valuable insights into the complex relationship between mobile phone usage and its effects on students' health and performance. While phones are 
   indispensable for studying and research, they also contribute to health issues that students are trying to manage through various precautions.

- **Project 6: Netflix Revenue** 

    This Power BI project provides an insightful analysis of Netflix’s revenue and membership growth between 2019 and 2023, focusing on key trends and regional breakdowns.

    During this period, Netflix’s revenue increased significantly, rising from $4.5 billion in 2019 to $8.5 billion in 2023. Memberships also grew steadily, from 0.77 billion to 0.98 
    billion. The faster growth in revenue compared to memberships suggests that Netflix has become more effective at generating revenue per subscriber, possibly through price increases 
    or added services. The quarterly revenue breakdown reveals consistent growth across all quarters, with certain periods contributing more strongly, suggesting seasonal fluctuations 
    in revenue generation.

    Globally, the EMEA and UCAN regions are Netflix’s largest revenue contributors, with EMEA accounting for 45.41% and UCAN 31.21% of total revenue. The membership distribution follows 
    a similar pattern, with EMEA and UCAN leading in subscriber numbers. However, the APAC region holds a higher share of memberships (18.18%) than its revenue contribution, signaling 
    untapped potential for monetization in this market.

    The growth of memberships has been steady, increasing each year, but at a slower pace than revenue growth, indicating that Netflix may be reaching market saturation or experiencing 
    slower subscriber acquisition. This supports the observation that Netflix is focusing on monetizing its existing user base more effectively.

    The regional revenue breakdown underscores the dominance of UCAN and EMEA, although UCAN’s growth has stabilized, while EMEA and APAC are seeing continuous increases. APAC, in 
    particular, shows strong growth potential in both revenue and membership share, indicating that this region may be a key driver of future growth.

    Overall, this project provides a detailed look at Netflix’s growth trajectory, highlighting its success in generating increasing revenue per subscriber, the key role of regions like 
    UCAN and EMEA, and the promising potential for growth in APAC.
