- **Project 1: Premier League 23-24**

   This project explores various metrics and performance indicators from the 2023/2024 Premier League season, based on data sourced from FBREF. By analyzing possession against 
   performance, there's a clear relationship between how much teams control the ball and their overall effectiveness. The chart highlights certain outliers, where teams like Manchester 
   City and Arsenal dominate possession, whereas others like Luton Town perform poorly despite similar possession metrics. Another analysis contrasts expected contributions (xG and 
   xAG) against actual contributions (goals and assists), showing which teams are overperforming or underperforming relative to their expected metrics. Notably, Liverpool, Manchester 
   City, and Arsenal stand out for outperforming their expected metrics, while teams like Sheffield United and Everton underperform significantly, as evidenced by the -14 contribution 
   for Everton.

   The goals breakdown offers insights into how teams score—whether through non-penalty goals (npG) or penalties (PK). Manchester City and Arsenal lead the table in overall goals, 
   showcasing their high offensive output. At the same time, teams like Sheffield United and Everton have significantly fewer goals, indicating clear issues in their attacking 
   performance. The relationship between squad age and performance is also explored, suggesting that teams with younger squads (around 25-26 years old) tend to perform better on non- 
   penalty expected goals (npxG), though there's a drop-off for both older and younger squads.

   The comparison between expected goals and actual performance further reinforces these findings, where top-performing teams like Manchester City and Arsenal consistently outperform 
   their xG. Meanwhile, teams such as Luton Town struggle to match their expected goals, highlighting inefficiency in converting chances. Another key aspect is progressive actions, 
   where progressive passes and carries (PrgA) are compared with goals and assists (G+A). Teams like Liverpool and Manchester City excel at turning progressive actions into tangible 
   outcomes, while lower-performing teams struggle to do so.

   Finally, the team efficiency chart captures the balance between assists (A) and goals (G). Teams like Manchester City, Arsenal, and Brighton demonstrate high efficiency, excelling 
   both in creating and finishing chances. On the other hand, teams such as Everton and Luton Town show inefficiency, with fewer assists and goals relative to other teams. These 
   findings suggest a significant divide in the league between high-performing, efficient teams and those that lag both in creating and converting opportunities.

- **Project 2: Chelsea FC**

   This Power BI project visualizes Chelsea Football Club's performance in the Premier League from 1990 to 2024, focusing on key metrics such as matches won, points, goals scored, goal 
   difference, and league position. The dashboard provides a historical view of Chelsea's progress and fluctuations over the years.

   The League Matches Won Per Season chart shows the number of matches Chelsea has won each season. Chelsea’s performance peaks in the mid-2000s, with notable highs such as 29 and 30 
   wins around 2005 and 2017, reflecting their dominance during these periods. However, the club's performance fluctuates in recent years, with a noticeable drop in wins after 2020.

   The Goal Difference Per Season graph further highlights Chelsea's varying fortunes. The goal difference climbs steadily from the 1990s, peaking at +71 in the early 2010s. This 
   period 
   marks Chelsea’s offensive and defensive prowess, especially under successful managers. However, more recent seasons show a marked decline in goal difference, even reaching negative 
   figures, which indicates struggles in both scoring and defense.

   The League Position Per Season line chart traces Chelsea’s standings in the Premier League. After consistently being mid-table in the early 1990s, the club experiences a sharp rise 
   in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, regularly finishing in the top six. Between 2010 and 2020, Chelsea is a frequent top-four finisher, but a slight dip in performance can be seen 
   post- 
   2020, with the club dropping to 12th place in 2023.

   The Points Per Season bar chart reflects similar trends. Points accumulate steadily from the early 1990s, peaking in the mid-2000s with 95 points in 2005, coinciding with Chelsea's 
   title-winning seasons. The points per season remain competitive until recent years, where a drop to 63 points in 2024 suggests Chelsea is facing more challenges.

   Lastly, the Goals Scored Per Season line chart reveals Chelsea's attacking output. While the club consistently scores between 50 to 70 goals for much of its Premier League history, 
   significant spikes—such as 103 goals in 2010—show exceptional attacking seasons. Recently, Chelsea's goal-scoring has been more moderate, reflecting both tactical shifts and 
   possible 
   attacking inefficiencies.

   In conclusion, this dashboard offers a detailed look at Chelsea's Premier League history. It highlights the club's peak dominance during the 2000s and early 2010s, followed by more 
   recent struggles in terms of wins, points, and league position. The visualizations provide a clear overview of Chelsea's performance trends over time, capturing key periods of 
   success and recent challenges.
  
- **Project 3: Coffee Consumption**
  
    I created a Power BI dashboard to analyze coffee consumption patterns, focusing on the types of coffee purchased, monthly spending trends, payment methods, and top card spenders. 
    This visualization aims to give a comprehensive look at how customers interact with different coffee types, their spending habits, and payment preferences over time.

    The "Money Spent Per Coffee Type" visualization reveals that lattes and Americanos with milk are the most popular, each accounting for over 10K in spending. Cappuccinos follow 
    closely with 8.2K, while Americanos and Cortados see less expenditure at 5K and 3.3K, respectively. Espresso and Cocoa have the least spending, with only 1.3K and 1.6K. This 
    pattern reflects a strong preference for milk-based coffee drinks among customers.

    In terms of consumption, Americanos with milk are consumed the most, with 319 orders, followed by lattes at 282, and cappuccinos at 222. This shows that despite the high 
    consumption numbers for Americanos with milk, customers are willing to spend more on lattes and cappuccinos. Cortados and hot chocolate also have significant consumption, but 
    espressos and cocoa remain the least consumed.

    Looking at the "Money Spent Per Month" analysis, there’s a clear peak in May, where spending hits 9.1K, followed by a gradual decrease through to August. April saw relatively 
    lower spending at 6.7K, and August hit the lowest point at 5.1K. This drop in spending might reflect a seasonal pattern or changing customer preferences. Similarly, the "Coffee 
    Consumption Per Month" graph follows a similar trend, peaking in May with 267 orders and seeing a decline to 180 orders in August.

    I also examined payment preferences, where card payments dominate, accounting for 92.53% of total transactions, while cash makes up only 7.47%. This indicates that most customers 
    prefer using cards for their coffee purchases, which could be tied to convenience or store incentives.

    The dashboard also highlights the top five card spenders, with the highest spender (AN00-0000-0000-0) reaching 2.8K. The other top spenders follow closely, but all are under 2.5K. 
    This section of the dashboard helps identify the most loyal and high-value customers.

    Overall, the dashboard provides valuable insights into customer preferences, monthly trends, and top spenders, allowing for better decision-making when it comes to marketing, 
    inventory, and customer service strategies.

- **Project 4: Store Sales**

    I worked on a comprehensive sales data analysis project using Power BI, focusing on different aspects of performance across products, regions, and customer behavior. The dashboard 
    provides a holistic view of the business operations, highlighting key areas such as top-selling products, profit distribution, and geographical performance.

    One of the most insightful visualizations is the breakdown of best-selling products, where staples have emerged as the highest-selling product by a significant margin. Other 
    products like Cardinal Index Tabs and Eldon File Carts follow, but with a much lower sales volume. I also looked into best-selling subcategories, where Binders lead the way, 
    followed by Storage and Art supplies, reflecting the popularity of office essentials.

    In terms of yearly sales, there's a clear upward trajectory, with sales growing steadily from 2011 to 2014. By 2014, sales reached over 60K, indicating consistent growth over the 
    four years. Profitability is analyzed by year, with 2014 being the most profitable year, contributing 34.36% of total profits. The profit split also shows that 2011 contributed the 
    least (16.98%), but still holds significance.

    I also analyzed customer data to understand the top customers. Tamara Chand stands out as the top customer, followed by Raymond Buch and Sanjit Chand, showing high levels of 
    engagement. These top customers have been crucial to maintaining the revenue base.

    From a geographical perspective, the most profitable regions were analyzed, and Central came out as the top performer with profits of 0.31M. Other regions such as North Asia and 
    North America also contributed significantly, but the Central region was the standout. The shipping costs analysis shows that standard class shipping was the most used option, 
    reflecting its efficiency and cost-effectiveness, compared to other modes like same-day delivery, which incurred higher costs.

    Lastly, I focused on profit across different categories, where Technology products generated the most profit at 663.7K, followed by Office Supplies at 518.47K. Furniture, although 
    a key product, generated less profit comparatively. The entire dashboard delivers an in-depth understanding of how different aspects of the business contribute to the overall 
    growth and profitability, helping to pinpoint key drivers and areas for improvement.

- **Project 5: Unicorns**
  
    This Power BI dashboard delivers a comprehensive analysis of the unicorn landscape, focusing on critical metrics such as valuations, funding sources, geographic distribution, and 
    industry-specific trends. The top-left bar chart illustrates the valuations of leading unicorn companies, with Bytedance leading at an impressive $180 billion, followed closely by 
    SpaceX at $100 billion and Stripe at $95 billion. This visualization effectively highlights the significant market presence and influence of these high-growth companies.

    The Industry Funding donut chart in the upper middle section provides insights into how different sectors attract investment. Fintech and e-commerce dominate the funding landscape, 
    underscoring the substantial investor interest in digital financial services and online commerce. This indicates a broader trend toward technology-driven solutions that cater to 
    evolving consumer behaviors, particularly in a post-pandemic world.

    In terms of geographic distribution, the Valuation by Continent pie chart reveals that North America accounts for over half (54.76%) of total unicorn valuations, followed by Asia 
    (28.75%) and Europe (13.55%). This geographic breakdown emphasizes the significant concentration of unicorns in North America, particularly in countries like USA and Canada, where 
    technological advancements have led to the rapid emergence of high-value startups. The accompanying Companies Distribution map visually reinforces this trend, showing clusters of 
    unicorns in North America, Europe, and Asia.

    The average funding metric, approximately $557.27 million, highlights the substantial investments flowing into these unicorns. The bar chart for Company Funding shows that Juul Labs 
    has raised the most funding at $14 billion, suggesting that companies with innovative products or disruptive business models are securing significant capital to fuel their growth.

    The valuation trend chart demonstrates a remarkable rise in unicorn valuations over the past decade, especially after 2020. This surge likely correlates with increased digital 
    adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, propelling the growth of companies in e-commerce, fintech, and internet services. The trend reflects the potential for sustained growth and 
    the attractiveness of these sectors to investors.

    Interactive elements on the right side of the dashboard allow users to filter the data based on country, industry, or specific companies. Users can also adjust valuation and funding 
    ranges, making the dashboard highly customizable. This feature enhances user engagement and enables analysts and investors to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.

    In summary, this Power BI dashboard presents a rich, data-driven view of the unicorn market. It highlights key insights regarding industry dominance, geographic trends, and funding 
    patterns, offering valuable information for stakeholders aiming to understand the dynamics of high-growth companies in the global economy. The combination of visualizations and 
    interactive features makes it a powerful tool for analyzing the unicorn landscape and supporting strategic investment decisions.

- **Project 6: Netflix** 

    I developed this dashboard to analyze the growth in revenue and memberships from 2019 to 2023, with a focus on regional contributions and global performance. The dashboard 
    showcases how both revenue and memberships have grown steadily, while also offering insights into the role that different regions play in the overall financial health of the 
    company.

    Starting with the Revenue vs. Memberships, it’s clear that revenue has steadily increased from $20 billion in 2019 to $34 billion by 2023, while memberships have risen from 0.63 
    billion to 0.98 billion in the same period. This illustrates a strong relationship between the company’s ability to add members and its growing revenue, though the increase in 
    revenue has slightly outpaced membership growth, suggesting potential factors like higher pricing or increased user engagement.

    The Quarterly Revenue Breakdown shows how revenue has been consistently strong across all quarters, with each year exhibiting growth over the previous one. By 2023, quarterly 
    revenue reached $8.8 billion in the last quarter, up from $4.5 billion in the first quarter of 2019. The steady increase across all quarters suggests that the company has been able 
    to manage its growth well, with no significant dips or volatility throughout the years, likely thanks to content releases, subscription packages, and market expansion.

    The Global Revenue Distribution shows that UCAN (United States and Canada) accounted for 45.41% of total revenue in 2023, making it the largest revenue-generating region. 
    EMEA (Europe, Middle East, and Africa) follows with 31.21%, showing its importance as a secondary market. APAC (Asia-Pacific) and LATM (Latin America) contributed smaller shares, 
    at 10.43% and 12.96%, respectively, highlighting their growth potential, though they currently trail behind the more mature markets of UCAN and EMEA.

    The Memberships Distribution presents a slightly different picture. UCAN holds 35.34% of the company’s total memberships, while EMEA has a comparable share at 32.55%. APAC and LATM 
    make up the rest, at 13.93% and 18.18%, respectively. While UCAN generates the most revenue, EMEA’s membership numbers are closely aligned, and both APAC and LATM, despite having 
    smaller revenue shares, have significant memberships. This disparity indicates that the revenue per member is higher in UCAN and EMEA compared to the other regions, potentially due 
    to pricing strategies or consumer spending power in these markets.

    The Global Revenue Breakdown provides further detail about the revenue composition by region over time. UCAN dominates with $14.5 billion in revenue by 2023, followed by EMEA at 
    $10.6 billion. APAC and LATM have grown steadily, contributing $3.8 billion and $4.4 billion, respectively. The increasing revenue from all regions signals a strong global presence 
    and suggests that emerging markets like APAC and LATM have potential for further growth.

    The Memberships Growth chart visualizes the rise in memberships from 0.63 billion in 2019 to 0.98 billion in 2023. The growth trend is steady but begins to flatten slightly in 
    2022 and 2023, indicating that membership growth may be slowing, particularly in more saturated markets like UCAN and EMEA. Despite this, the company has managed to maintain a 
    positive trajectory, hinting at continued expansion opportunities in under-penetrated regions such as APAC and LATM.

    Overall, this dashboard provides a comprehensive view of how revenue and membership growth are closely tied to geographic regions. UCAN and EMEA continue to lead in both metrics, 
    while APAC and LATM show promise as emerging contributors to future growth. The stable increase in revenue and memberships reflects a strong global strategy, although the data also 
    suggests that new growth strategies may be necessary to continue expanding in more saturated regions.
