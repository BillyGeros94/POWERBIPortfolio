- **Project 1: Premier League 23-24**

    This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Premier League team performances in the 2023-2024 season, focusing on possession, expected goals (xG), actual 
    contributions, and team efficiency. The dashboard's interactive slicers—team, age, possession, goals and non-penalty expected goals—allow users to explore specific team dynamics and 
    compare metrics across the league.

    In the Possession vs. Performance chart, teams like Manchester City and Arsenal show high possession and strong non-penalty expected goals (npxG), while lower-possession teams like 
    Brentford also perform well, indicating different tactical approaches. The Expected Contributions vs. Actual Contributions graph highlights overperforming teams like Manchester City 
    and Arsenal, while Everton and Wolves underperform, suggesting inefficiencies in turning opportunities into results.

    The Goals vs. Expected Goals chart shows that teams like Manchester City and Arsenal exceed their expected goals, while Everton significantly underperforms, showing a gap in 
    converting chances. The Goals Breakdown provides insight into how teams score, separating open-play goals from penalties, with top teams like Manchester City and Arsenal scoring 
    consistently across both types.

    The Performance vs. Squad Age chart reveals that squads in their mid-20s, such as Manchester City’s, tend to perform better, suggesting an optimal age range for peak performance. In 
    the Expected Goals (xG) vs. Actual Performance scatter plot, teams like Arsenal and Aston Villa outperform their xG predictions, while others fall below expectations, pointing to 
    tactical or execution issues.

    The Progressive Actions vs. Goals/Assists chart shows teams like Tottenham effectively translating attacking movements into goals and assists, while some teams struggle to make 
    their progressive actions count. Finally, the Team Efficiency chart highlights Manchester City and Arsenal as the most efficient teams in converting possession into high-quality 
    results, while clubs like Brentford and Brighton maximize their output despite lower possession stats.

    Overall, this project showcases team performance trends, providing valuable insights into how possession, expected metrics, and squad age affect success in the Premier League.

- **Project 2: Chelsea FC**

    This Power BI project includes slicers for season, team, league position, and goals scored, providing an interactive way to filter and explore the data.

    We chose to focus on Chelsea for this analysis, using the slicers to examine their performance over time.

    The "League Matches Won Per Season" chart shows Chelsea's progression, with a noticeable improvement in the early 2000s, peaking between 2004 and 2010 when the club consistently won 
    24-29 matches. There is a significant dip in wins during 2023, with only 11 victories, but a slight recovery to 18 wins in 2024.

    In the "Goals Scored Per Season" chart, Chelsea's goal-scoring improved significantly in the early 2000s, with a peak of 103 goals in 2010. A decline in the 2022-2023 period, where 
    Chelsea only managed 38 goals, reflects offensive struggles, but the club rebounds to 77 goals by 2024.

    The "League Position Per Season" graph highlights Chelsea’s rise to dominance, moving from mid-table finishes in the 1990s to frequent top-four positions in the 2000s and 2010s. 
    However, there is a sharp drop to 12th place in 2023, followed by a return to 6th place in 2024.

    The "Points Per Season" visualization mirrors Chelsea’s performance trends, with consistent high points in their peak years, including 95 points in 2005. A major low occurs in 2023 
    with only 44 points, but a recovery to 63 points in 2024 shows signs of improvement.

    Lastly, the "Goal Difference Per Season" chart shows Chelsea’s dominance in the 2000s, with a high of +71 in 2010. A steep decline to -9 in 2023 reflects poor defense and attack 
    that year, but by 2024, Chelsea has returned to a positive goal difference of +14.

    This project effectively demonstrates Chelsea's rise, fall, and recent recovery, providing clear insights into the club’s long-term Premier League trajectory.

    This Power BI dashboard delivers a thorough, interactive analysis of video game sales, focusing on publishers, platforms, genres, and regional performance. Users can filter by 
    publisher, platform, genre, title, year, and sales range, making it easy to explore industry trends.

    The Publishers Sales Distribution chart clearly shows Nintendo's dominance, especially in North America and Japan, with Electronic Arts and Sony also holding notable shares. This 
    breakdown helps visualize how different regions contribute to each publisher's success.

    The Yearly Published Titles line chart tracks the industry's growth, showing a steady rise in releases, peaking around 2010. The decline afterward may reflect shifts to mobile 
    gaming or fewer but higher-quality releases. This gives a historical overview of the industry's development.

    In the Titles by Genre pie chart, Action and Sports games lead sales, while Role-Playing and Shooter genres maintain solid positions. This reveals consumer preferences and the types 
    of games that tend to perform well globally.

    The Platform Sales donut chart shows that consoles like the PS2, X360, and PS3 have driven the most sales, giving insight into which platforms shaped the market. This ties into 
    the Yearly Sales Trend chart, where sales peaked around 2008-2010, coinciding with these consoles' dominance.

    The Title Sales bar chart highlights individual game successes, with Wii Sports topping the list, underscoring the influence of blockbuster titles on overall sales. Meanwhile, the 
    Publisher Sales bar chart reaffirms Nintendo’s market leadership, followed by Electronic Arts and Activision.

    The Genre Sales bar chart confirms that Action and Sports games dominate the market, providing a clear comparison of how different genres perform.

    Overall, this dashboard combines historical, geographical, and genre-based analysis to offer key insights into the video game industry. It is visually compelling, interactive, and 
    provides a well-rounded view of sales trends, making it a strong portfolio project that showcases advanced data visualization and analytical skills.

    industry-specific trends. The top-left bar chart illustrates the valuations of leading unicorn companies, with Bytedance leading at an impressive $180 billion, followed closely by 
    SpaceX at $100 billion and Stripe at $95 billion. This visualization effectively highlights the significant market presence and influence of these high-growth companies.

    The Industry Funding donut chart in the upper middle section provides insights into how different sectors attract investment. Fintech and e-commerce dominate the funding landscape, 
    underscoring the substantial investor interest in digital financial services and online commerce. This indicates a broader trend toward technology-driven solutions that cater to 
    evolving consumer behaviors, particularly in a post-pandemic world.

    In terms of geographic distribution, the Valuation by Continent pie chart reveals that North America accounts for over half (54.76%) of total unicorn valuations, followed by Asia 
    (28.75%) and Europe (13.55%). This geographic breakdown emphasizes the significant concentration of unicorns in North America, particularly in countries like USA and Canada, where 
    technological advancements have led to the rapid emergence of high-value startups. The accompanying Companies Distribution map visually reinforces this trend, showing clusters of 
    unicorns in North America, Europe, and Asia.

    The average funding metric, approximately $557.27 million, highlights the substantial investments flowing into these unicorns. The bar chart for Company Funding shows that Juul Labs 
    has raised the most funding at $14 billion, suggesting that companies with innovative products or disruptive business models are securing significant capital to fuel their growth.

    The valuation trend chart demonstrates a remarkable rise in unicorn valuations over the past decade, especially after 2020. This surge likely correlates with increased digital 
    adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic, propelling the growth of companies in e-commerce, fintech, and internet services. The trend reflects the potential for sustained growth and 
    the attractiveness of these sectors to investors.

    Interactive elements on the right side of the dashboard allow users to filter the data based on country, industry, or specific companies. Users can also adjust valuation and funding 
    ranges, making the dashboard highly customizable. This feature enhances user engagement and enables analysts and investors to delve deeper into specific areas of interest.
