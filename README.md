- **Project 1: Premier League 23-24**

    This Power BI project provides a comprehensive analysis of Premier League team performances in the 2023-2024 season, focusing on possession, expected goals (xG), actual 
    contributions, and team efficiency. The dashboard's interactive slicers—team, age, possession, goals and non-penalty expected goals—allow users to explore specific team dynamics and 
    compare metrics across the league.

    In the Possession vs. Performance chart, teams like Manchester City and Arsenal show high possession and strong non-penalty expected goals (npxG), while lower-possession teams like 
    Brentford also perform well, indicating different tactical approaches. The Expected Contributions vs. Actual Contributions graph highlights overperforming teams like Manchester City 
    and Arsenal, while Everton and Wolves underperform, suggesting inefficiencies in turning opportunities into results.

    The Goals vs. Expected Goals chart shows that teams like Manchester City and Arsenal exceed their expected goals, while Everton significantly underperforms, showing a gap in 
    converting chances. The Goals Breakdown provides insight into how teams score, separating open-play goals from penalties, with top teams like Manchester City and Arsenal scoring 
    consistently across both types.

    The Performance vs. Squad Age chart reveals that squads in their mid-20s, such as Manchester City’s, tend to perform better, suggesting an optimal age range for peak performance. In 
    the Expected Goals (xG) vs. Actual Performance scatter plot, teams like Arsenal and Aston Villa outperform their xG predictions, while others fall below expectations, pointing to 
    tactical or execution issues.

    The Progressive Actions vs. Goals/Assists chart shows teams like Tottenham effectively translating attacking movements into goals and assists, while some teams struggle to make 
    their progressive actions count. Finally, the Team Efficiency chart highlights Manchester City and Arsenal as the most efficient teams in converting possession into high-quality 
    results, while clubs like Brentford and Brighton maximize their output despite lower possession stats.

    Overall, this project showcases team performance trends, providing valuable insights into how possession, expected metrics, and squad age affect success in the Premier League.

- **Project 2: Chelsea FC**

    This Power BI project includes slicers for season, team, league position, and goals scored, providing an interactive way to filter and explore the data.

    We chose to focus on Chelsea for this analysis, using the slicers to examine their performance over time.

    The "League Matches Won Per Season" chart shows Chelsea's progression, with a noticeable improvement in the early 2000s, peaking between 2004 and 2010 when the club consistently won 
    24-29 matches. There is a significant dip in wins during 2023, with only 11 victories, but a slight recovery to 18 wins in 2024.

    In the "Goals Scored Per Season" chart, Chelsea's goal-scoring improved significantly in the early 2000s, with a peak of 103 goals in 2010. A decline in the 2022-2023 period, where 
    Chelsea only managed 38 goals, reflects offensive struggles, but the club rebounds to 77 goals by 2024.

    The "League Position Per Season" graph highlights Chelsea’s rise to dominance, moving from mid-table finishes in the 1990s to frequent top-four positions in the 2000s and 2010s. 
    However, there is a sharp drop to 12th place in 2023, followed by a return to 6th place in 2024.

    The "Points Per Season" visualization mirrors Chelsea’s performance trends, with consistent high points in their peak years, including 95 points in 2005. A major low occurs in 2023 
    with only 44 points, but a recovery to 63 points in 2024 shows signs of improvement.

    Lastly, the "Goal Difference Per Season" chart shows Chelsea’s dominance in the 2000s, with a high of +71 in 2010. A steep decline to -9 in 2023 reflects poor defense and attack 
    that year, but by 2024, Chelsea has returned to a positive goal difference of +14.

    This project effectively demonstrates Chelsea's rise, fall, and recent recovery, providing clear insights into the club’s long-term Premier League trajectory.
  
- **Project 3: Pizza Sales**

    In this Power BI project, I developed a dashboard that provides insights into pizza sales and customer trends for a pizza restaurant. The dashboard is designed to optimize the 
    restaurant's menu and enhance sales performance. The first section highlights total revenue, which amounts to $818K, showcasing the restaurant's performance over a specific period. 
    Sales are broken down by pizza category, with the "Supreme" pizza category leading in sales at $220K, followed closely by "Classic" at $208K, "Chicken" at $196K, and "Veggie" at 
    $194K. This pie chart visualization makes it easy to understand the proportion of sales each category contributes to overall revenue.

    Daily customer trends are plotted over time, where it is observed that the number of daily customers varies month by month. In January, the restaurant had 1685 customers, but by 
    February, this number dropped to 1773, followed by a gradual recovery peaking in Juy with 1935 customers. These fluctuations may provide key insights into how seasonal changes 
    or external factors influence customer visits, allowing the restaurant to make more informed business decisions.

    Revenue trends per month reveal that July is the top revenue-generating month at $73K, while May follows closely at $71K. Interestingly, November also brought in $70K despite the 
    dip in customer numbers during that month. These insights may be useful in scheduling promotions or managing inventory based on expected traffic and revenue. Alongside this, the top 
    10 best-selling pizzas are highlighted in a bar chart, showcasing pizzas like "The Classic Deluxe Pizza", "The Barbecue Chicken Pizza" and "The Thai Chicken Pizza" as some of the 
    best performers, each contributing around 2.4K in sales.

    The second part of the dashboard focuses on menu optimization. It shows the restaurant's average number of pizzas sold per order at 2, and the average order price is $38.31. The 
    promotional opportunities section is especially important for identifying where improvements can be made. A scatter plot visualizes the relationship between quantity sold and 
    revenue for different pizzas, where certain underperforming pizzas are identified as potential areas for promotion or reformulation. For instance, pizzas like "The Brie Carre 
    Pizza," which sold 490 units, but at a significantly lower price of $23.85, may require promotional strategies to increase sales.

    The underperforming pizzas list also sheds light on pizzas like "The Mediterranean Pizza" and "The Calabrese Pizza," which have sold below expectations despite having higher price 
    points compared to other pizzas. Identifying these underperformers allows the restaurant to reconsider their pricing, recipe, or even promotional efforts to boost sales. Filters on 
    the dashboard provide an interactive way to explore data further, allowing users to narrow down the information by pizza category, month, or specific pizza names.

    In essence, this dashboard offers a comprehensive overview of the restaurant's sales performance, customer behavior, and opportunities for growth. By understanding which pizzas are 
    performing well and which are not, the restaurant can make data-driven decisions to optimize its menu, offer targeted promotions, and ultimately boost its overall profitability. The 
    project demonstrates a clear use of data visualization to streamline operations and maximize sales.
