- **Project 1: Book Sales**

    An interactive Book Sales Dashboard designed to provide an in-depth analysis of book sales performance. The dashboard begins with an overview, highlighting key metrics such as the total number of authors, genres, and overall book sales.

    This is followed by a detailed breakdown, featuring visually engaging charts that offer deeper insights. A horizontal bar chart showcases the top 5 selling genres, while a vertical bar chart displays the top 5 publishers. Additionally, bar charts provide a clear view of the best-selling authors and books, complete with well-structured legends for easy interpretation.

    Through intuitive visualizations and interactive elements, the dashboard enables users to explore and analyze book sales data effectively.

- **Project 2: Chelsea PL Data**

   This Power BI project visualizes Chelsea Football Club's performance in the Premier League from 1990 to 2025, focusing on key metrics such as matches won, points, goals scored, goal 
   difference, and league position. The dashboard provides a historical view of Chelsea's progress and fluctuations over the years.

   The League Matches Won Per Season chart shows the number of matches Chelsea has won each season. Chelsea’s performance peaks in the mid-2000s, with notable highs such as 29 and 30 
   wins around 2005 and 2015, reflecting their dominance during these periods. However, the club's performance fluctuates in recent years, with a noticeable drop in wins after 2020.

   The Goal Difference Per Season graph further highlights Chelsea's varying fortunes. The goal difference climbs steadily from the 1990s, peaking at +71 in the early 2010s. This period 
   marks Chelsea’s offensive and defensive prowess, especially under successful managers. However, more recent seasons show a marked decline in goal difference, even reaching negative 
   figures, which indicates struggles in both scoring and defense.

   The League Position Per Season line chart traces Chelsea’s standings in the Premier League. After consistently being mid-table in the early 1990s, the club experiences a sharp rise 
   in the mid-1990s to early 2000s, regularly finishing in the top six. Between 2010 and 2020, Chelsea is a frequent top-four finisher, but a slight dip in performance can be seen post- 
   2020, with the club dropping to 12th place in 2023.

   The Points Per Season bar chart reflects similar trends. Points accumulate steadily from the early 1990s, peaking in the mid-2000s with 95 points in 2005, coinciding with Chelsea's 
   title-winning seasons. The points per season remain competitive until recent years, where a drop to 63 points in 2023 suggests Chelsea is facing more challenges.

   Lastly, the Goals Scored Per Season line chart reveals Chelsea's attacking output. While the club consistently scores between 50 to 70 goals for much of its Premier League history, 
   significant spikes—such as 103 goals in 2010—show exceptional attacking seasons. Recently, Chelsea's goal-scoring has been more moderate, reflecting both tactical shifts and possible 
   attacking inefficiencies.

   In conclusion, this dashboard offers a detailed look at Chelsea's Premier League history. It highlights the club's peak dominance during the 2000s and early 2010s, followed by more 
   recent struggles in terms of wins, points, and league position. The visualizations provide a clear overview of Chelsea's performance trends over time, capturing key periods of 
   success and recent challenges.
  
- **Project 3: Coffee Consumption Dataset**
  
    This interactive report offers an in-depth analysis of coffee consumption patterns through a variety of engaging visualizations.

    The report features horizontal bar charts that display coffee consumption by type, providing a clear comparison across different coffee varieties. Vertical bar charts highlight the amount of money spent per coffee type, along with insights into the top card payers. To illustrate trends over time, line graphs are used to track monthly coffee consumption and spending.

    Additionally, a donut chart showcases the distribution of money spent by payment method, offering a visually appealing breakdown of customer payment preferences. Together, these visualizations provide a comprehensive view of coffee consumption habits and spending patterns, empowering users to explore the data in an interactive and intuitive way.

- **Project 4: Store Sales Data**

    This report provides a comprehensive analysis of key metrics from a store sales dataset through a variety of detailed visualizations.

    Vertical bar charts are utilized to display the store's best-selling products, total shipping costs by shipping method, and the most profitable regions, offering clear insights into these crucial aspects. A horizontal bar chart highlights the best-selling subcategories, while an interactive map visually represents the five most profitable countries by profit.

    Additionally, a donut chart showcases profitability across different years, and a treemap chart breaks down profitability by category for a more granular view. A funnel chart is also included to visualize the store's top clients by profit, allowing for an easy comparison of customer contributions to profitability. Together, these visualizations provide a holistic view of sales performance and profitability across various dimensions.

- **Project 5: Student Mobile Health Effects**
  
   This interactive dashboard presents the results of a survey on students' perceptions of mobile health effects, offering a comprehensive view through various visualizations.

   A donut chart is used to display the gender distribution of the participants, while a stacked vertical bar chart visualizes the mobile operating systems (OS) used by students, broken down by gender. Vertical bar charts are employed to illustrate students' responses to key questions, such as daily mobile usage, beneficial subjects of mobile use, the frequency of health symptoms, and precautions taken for mobile usage.

   Horizontal bar charts are used to present the percentages of students who reported the impact of mobile phones on their academic performance and the appearance of specific health symptoms related to mobile phone use. Each visualization is expressed as a percentage, providing clear insights into the students' collective responses. This interactive dashboard allows users to explore the effects of mobile phone usage on health and performance in an intuitive manner. 

- **Project 6: Netflix Revenue** 

    This Power BI project provides an insightful analysis of Netflix’s revenue and membership growth between 2019 and 2023, focusing on key trends and regional breakdowns.

    During this period, Netflix’s revenue increased significantly, rising from $4.5 billion in 2019 to $8.5 billion in 2023. Memberships also grew steadily, from 0.77 billion to 0.98 
    billion. The faster growth in revenue compared to memberships suggests that Netflix has become more effective at generating revenue per subscriber, possibly through price increases 
    or added services. The quarterly revenue breakdown reveals consistent growth across all quarters, with certain periods contributing more strongly, suggesting seasonal fluctuations 
    in revenue generation.

    Globally, the EMEA and UCAN regions are Netflix’s largest revenue contributors, with EMEA accounting for 45.41% and UCAN 31.21% of total revenue. The membership distribution follows 
    a similar pattern, with EMEA and UCAN leading in subscriber numbers. However, the APAC region holds a higher share of memberships (18.18%) than its revenue contribution, signaling 
    untapped potential for monetization in this market.

    The growth of memberships has been steady, increasing each year, but at a slower pace than revenue growth, indicating that Netflix may be reaching market saturation or experiencing 
    slower subscriber acquisition. This supports the observation that Netflix is focusing on monetizing its existing user base more effectively.

    The regional revenue breakdown underscores the dominance of UCAN and EMEA, although UCAN’s growth has stabilized, while EMEA and APAC are seeing continuous increases. APAC, in 
    particular, shows strong growth potential in both revenue and membership share, indicating that this region may be a key driver of future growth.

    Overall, this project provides a detailed look at Netflix’s growth trajectory, highlighting its success in generating increasing revenue per subscriber, the key role of regions like 
    UCAN and EMEA, and the promising potential for growth in APAC.
